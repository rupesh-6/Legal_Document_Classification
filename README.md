INTRODUCTION

The rapid growth of digital legal documents and citizen petitions has created a pressing need for automation in public legal institutions
such as the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Paraná (MPPR), Brazil. With thousands of petitions received monthly, the current manual classification process—often performed 
by non-specialized staff—is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to misclassification, leading to delays in legal processing and misallocation of resources.
This project is motivated by the need to streamline this workflow using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to develop an 
automated system capable of classifying legal petitions into predefined categories such as Family Law, Health, Education, and more. The core objective is to build a robust, accurate, 
and scalable model that can process short textual descriptions of petitions and assign them to one of 18 legal areas using a combination of domain-specific word embeddings and deep learning
models like LSTM. The scope of the project includes data preprocessing in Portuguese, model training using both traditional and neural classifiers, and evaluation based on accuracy and F1-score. 
Key challenges include class imbalance, semantic overlap between legal categories, and the complexities of processing Portuguese legal text. Despite these hurdles, the proposed solution offers the potential 
to significantly enhance efficiency, accuracy, and transparency in legal document management systems.
